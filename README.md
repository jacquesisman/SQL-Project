# SQL-Project


Project Name : Project 
Project Objective : find insights from data and conduct research to help drive users 

What problem are you solving?
- I was trying to solve both content and app features to be improved. Finding out what is the best content to be producing and how app features can help drive more users and complement these contents being provided. 
How are you solving this problem?
- Because it is a start up the most important thing is driving up the users whilst it is still not making revenue yet. 

Job Description
- The company I am in is a start up that has a app that provides many contents to Indonesia. It is in the entertainment industry. The app itself is to help gain users and allow them to have a great experience listening to these contents. 
- My job titles Is a product researcher where by I need to find insights from data and conduct research to help drive KPI with feature development. The industry this start up is in is the entertainment industry. And why I selected this job is because I want to experience the differences in culture with different industries but also the difference in culture due to being a start up and not a big corporation.

Breifly explain how the project is related to the job posting
- I needed to use Youtube API which is related to our learning. We have learned about scraping through the use of API and web scraping. Taking my knowledge from there I was able to implement it into this project whilst it being a different API. 

Data:

Source
  - Youtube 
  - Generated Fake Data 
 
Characteristics
  - the use of ID's to specify content, genre, catalog
  - titles to know which are being listened to the most 
  - implemented users to show durations of the app being used and what they are watching/listening too
  - the data is quite still incomplete but accurate from the data i started the API 
  - the data is very relavant to what I needed to find and research on 

Notebooks: 

API 
http://localhost:8890/notebooks/Desktop/Developing%20Apps/Project%20milestone%202/Data_Collection_Deddy_Corbuzier.ipynb
- to be able to obtain the data from youtube using youtube API 



Future Improvements
- Be able to link the youtube channels into one database 
- Obtain more from youtube if possible so more comparisons with the startup data can be made so it can be more realistic to a competitive analysis
- other analysis such as loss of traffic or things of that nature from youtube can possibly be scraped as well
